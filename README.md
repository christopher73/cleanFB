# cleanFB

Many of us probably heard about the exposure of peoples Facebook data recently. And as a result I came across an article by (http://www.jaruzel.com/blog/How-I-Erased-5000-Facebook-Comments-and-Likes) where he developed a tool to erase post from facebook, but this was written in Python so I told my self why not in JavaScript since Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings does support JS

set the following variables
FB_PASS=fb_pass
FB_EMAIL=fb_email
